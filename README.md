# compare-u
SWE 432 Project

NOTE:
deployed on Heroku at compare-u.herokuapp.com

Can also be run using `node server.js`

Four scenarios:

1. Users can register and login

2. Users can see detailed information about one specific university at a time

3. Users can compare multiple universities using a radar chart implemented with D3

4. Users can save favorite universities if they are logged in


For HW5 we have implemented 1, 2, and 3. Scenario 4 is not working at the moment. 1, 2, and 3 all use React.

My group change as Sam Brady has left the class, my new Partners are CLifford Baker and Anthony Nguyen and they are working on this repo also.
